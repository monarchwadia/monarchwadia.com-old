> A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of utopias.  
> _Oscar Wilde_

Hi. My name is Monarch Wadia.

In my professional life, I'm a software developer and a CEO. Some of you may know me for my work at [Mintbean](https://mintbean.io). You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/monarchwadia) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/monarchwadia).

This site is a place for me to put aside my professional thoughts in favour of a different kind of work.
