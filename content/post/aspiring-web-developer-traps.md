Footguns are ways you can shoot yourself in the foot. Junior devs face many footguns which aren't obvious at all, except in hindsight. Here are a few that I've seen in my work at Mintbean.

## Customization Trap

One of the biggest ways I see people failing is the Customization Trap. This is when you customize every single job application to match the job description. 

DO NOT FALL INTO THIS TRAP. 

You will get exhausted from the effort and won't have time to actually code. You will also get very emotionally invested in each and every job application, then get discouraged when the inevitable failures start to roll in.

Instead, have 1 or 2 standard versions of your resumes. Send them out to every job you encounter. Track their performance and iterate them over time.

## Rejection Trauma Trap

The 2nd biggest way to fail is to take rejections personally. 

Look. 99% of most junior devs' job applications end in rejection. So it's illogical to assume that 99% of people out there are worthless.

You are a very valuable person -- every person is. Don't blame your skills, they (probably) aren't to blame.

Instead, figure out why you're being rejected and fix that. Ask yourself: "At which point in the process do I normally get rejected?" and that should lead you in the right direction.

## Overthinking Trap

I'm guilty of this one. 

Stop thinking so much about your resume, your LI profile, etc. 

Just send your resume out to a few hundred jobs, wait for the results, then iterate based on where you're failing. 

Stop over-engineering your job process.

## If-I-Build-It-They-Will-Come Fallacy

This is when an aspiring engineer thinks they'll find a job if they just focus on their skills, their projects, or their portfolio. 

Most people who fall into this fallacy are actually extremely smart, absolutely love coding, and end up getting a job in the very long run (\~1-3 years). If there's a trap you're going to fall into, this might be one of the better ones.

However, without outreach efforts, you have very slim chances of being noticed. Finding a job = Quantity x Quality. If you just focus on quality, you'll get nowhere in the short run.

To get out of this trap, set aside about 2 hours per day to focus on your job hunt. Just a couple hours a day will do you a lot of good. Write a decent resume, spruce up your LinkedIn and Github, and send out some jobs. I usually recommend doing 20-30 jobs a week, if not more. It's totally doable in 2 hours a day.

## To-Do Trap

"If I make and follow a list of technologies to learn, I'll eventually be hireable."

I hate to break it to you, but that won't help. Just goes against human nature.

First off, it's super discouraging to have an ever-growing list of things you don't know. 

Secondly, coding will become a chore. Why would you want to take one of the most fulfilling,  interesting and inspiring activities in the world (coding) and turn it into a chore? Don't do it. 

Instead, build projects from your imagination. 

It's a lot more fun, a lot more fulfilling, and you'll actually be more likely to learn things that will make you hireable.

## Tutorial hell 

Tutorials are great in small doses. 

In larger quantities, they can be destructive addictions. 

I've met people who can build a Twitter clone in 3 short days by following a tutorial, but can't even put together a decent Todo app in a whole week. 

Then, because they can't put together a Todo app, they'll feel stupid, and go right back to another tutorial which will make them feel smart again. 

To get over this trap, you need to first stop doing tutorials and start building real projects. If you do this, you can still use tutorials to get over a specific issue you're having (such as how to build authentication), in addition to Google, Stack Overflow and official documentation.
