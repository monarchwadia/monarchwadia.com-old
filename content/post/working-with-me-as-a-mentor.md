This isn't as much a post, as it is a list of questions that I frequently ask my mentees. I'm placing these here so I can refer to them, and also in case others want to use them to help themselves.

Applying for jobs is like passing through customs. There are multiple levels of paperwork, scans, interviews, inspections and examinations -- and you can be rejected for a reason without getting any feedback. To help me debug exactly where you're failing, please answer the following questions for me. Ballpark answers are fine, you don't need to be precise.

# Profile

- What are your strongest skills?
- What kind of job are you targeting? What skills are they looking for?
- What city/cities are you actively looking for work in?
- Are you OK with remote work?

# Efficiency

- How often do you customize your job applications?
- How long do you take to apply to one job, on average?
- What job boards do you use?

# Quantity

- How many jobs do you apply to every week? And what kinds of jobs do you apply to?
- How many people do you network with every week? And what job title(s) do they generally hold?
- How many screening calls do you get per week?
- How many screening calls do you successfully pass per week?
- How many 1st stage non-technical interviews do you get per week?

# Finances
