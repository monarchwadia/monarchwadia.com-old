# Why people don't apply to lots of jobs

Most people don't apply to lots of jobs because it's painful.

There are 2 main sources of pain during the job hunt.

1. Rejections
2. Lack of feedback (you don't know why you're being rejected)

# How to apply to more jobs

Therefore it stands to reason that, if you want to apply to more jobs, you need to do some combination of two things:

1. Make rejections less painful
2. Get more feedback

# How to make rejections feel less painful

In my experience, the pain of rejection has nothing to do with your personal skills, your self-esteem, or anything else. It just has to do with the average amount of time spent applying for a given job.

Human psychology is strange; the more time you spend applying for a job, the more invested you get in it. If you spend 1 hour applying to Acme Inc. and 5 minutes applying to Brunhilde LLC (made-up companies), then you'll be way more interested in Acme than you will be in Brunhilde.

In order to make rejections feel less painful, _you must spend less time on each individual job application._

How do you do this?

1. Stop customizing resumes. Instead, have 1 or 2 standard resumes that you send out to each job with ZERO customization.
2. When asked for a cover letter, send no more than 1 paragraph. If the cover letter is optional, skip it.
3. When presented with a lengthy form to fill, save the job in an excel sheet titled "Long job apps." Only dip into this list when you've absolutely exhausted the other jobs.
4. Use Indeed's Instant Apply

Using these tips, you should be able to bring the average time per application down to about 2-3 minutes. If you can do this, you'll be a machine, applying to about 20 to 30 jobs per hour. (holy smokes)

# How to get more feedback

I'm not a big fan of "getting feedback." I know vanishingly few people who are actually good at writing resumes. It's easy to get bad advice from people who don't know what they're doing (regardless of their job title, or how much people respect them.)

It's better to track your conversion rate on an excel sheet. A conversion rate is the percentage of people who responded to your job applications. You can calculate it by dividing the number of responses by the number of total job applications. Bear in mind that it takes up to 2 weeks for people to get back in touch with you, and it's difficult to calculate a conversion rate with anything less than 60 job applications. So you'll need to wait at least that long, and apply to that many jobs, before you can reliably calculate your conversion rate. See above section on how to make rejections feel less painful.

A good conversion rate for a junior developer resume is about 5%; and 10% is an exceptionally good resume. I've seen people apply to 1,100+ jobs with barely 2 or 3 responses -- don't be that person. Iterate fast, and make changes to your resume every other day.
